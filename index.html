                <p>
                    Hey you! :) I've created this personal home page, because I wanto to write a little bit about myself, my motivations, my philosophy and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First all of, let me introduce myself to you. As you probably guess, my name is Felipe Appio and I am a full-stack software developer. I work at Senior Sistemas's Applied Research & Archtecture department. Senior Sistemas it's one of the majors software
                    developer companies in Brazil, known mainly because of it's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software named Sapiens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We (applied research team) are working on a large scale recommender engine applied to B2B model. But before I starting writing a little deeper about some of my current dutties here, let me write a story to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I was twelve-years old my brother was doing his bachelor's thesis which was programming a PacMac game using AgentSpeak language. That thing really got my attention, so in the next few months I was bagging to him teach me programming, because I wanted
                    to "build a game too" (I think it's something like that I had said to him).
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was so annoyed with me bothering them all the time about it, that someday he said to me: - "Ok, Felipe! you won. I'll teach how to programming, but you have to promiss me that you will stay focused and do as I as I. We gotta deal?" And a I said:
                    </br> - "Ok, we gotta a deal, man! thanks for believe me!". And that was the very beginning of my journey as a software developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That experience with my brother it touched me, and inspired me to conquer my bachelor degree in Information Systems at Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (UDESC). I think it worths to mention that this course has received score in a national exam,
                    named Exame Nacional de Desempenho do Estudante (ENADE) which it's purpose it's measure course's quality. During that journey I was able work at a lot of projects:
                    <p>
                        </br>
                        - I developed a software applied to third sector (a rest home for old people)
                        </br>
                        - I also worked on a quizz game development team
                        </br>
                        - I've participed of a team which was resposible for building a Facebook game aiming to simulate the UDESC's campi.
                        </br>
                        - During almost three years I was a scholar fellowship holder responsible for help and monitor the academic's performance of a lot of disciplines (mostly Databases, Algorithms, Programming).
                        </br>
                        - I've participated of a lot others UDESC internal projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, still regarding my Bsch degree, I received my thesis in 2015 july, which was a tool for doing Opinion Mining (OM) on Facebook data. To do that, I’ve scikit-learn Multinomial Naïve Bayes combined Natural with some Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                        techniques available at Natural Language Processing (NLTK) framework.
                        </br>
